			My word content for this page is retrieved from "It’s Cute, but This Cat Probably Wasn’t Feeding Its Toy Kittens By JoAnna Klein
            Feline behaviorists offered explanations for a viral tweet that captured a cat’s tendency to bring stuffed toys to its food bowl." I also use baidu image search for cat images.
            <br/><br/>In the United States, there are more than 74 million pet cats. We love these spastic weirdos. So when Maureen Johnson, an author of best-selling young adult novels, tweeted about her parents’ cat’s strange behavior 
			during a visit home early this week — it went viral. 
			<br/><br/>It seemed like he was feeding them. But he also regularly eats their faces. 
			Was he really trying to feed his toy babies? Was he stowing away treasure? Did Sherlock think he was the leader of some kind of secret cat society? 
			It’s easy to project our human thoughts and feelings onto a cat and its behavior, but something else might be going on. (comment: below content and pictures I retrieved from https://www.purina.com/cats/cat-breeds "purina.com website")

		   <p class="h2">Cat bread: Abyssinian</p>
		   <p >Regal and highly intelligent, the Abyssinian is best described in one word: busy. Not a lap cat, this insatiably curious breed is always on the move, except when eating or sleeping. A fascinating, gorgeous breed, the Abyssinian is a natural athlete, with a muscular body and no fear of heights. The Aby is an affectionate, 
		   loyal, people-oriented companion that is well-suited for families with children older than 6.</p>

           <p class="h2">Cat bread: American Bobtail</p>
		   <p>Confident and friendly, the American Bobtail is a highly intelligent breed with a clownlike personality. Looking much like a bobtailed wildcat, this rare and athletic breed can be taught to walk on a leash. The American Bobtail has two coat varieties, shorthair and longhair, and does not reach adulthood until 2 or 3 years old. A devoted family companion, 
		   this cat interacts well with people of all ages and is ideal with children.</p>

           <p class="h2">Cat bread: American Curl</p>
		   <p>The American Curl has distinctive curled ears that form a graceful arc, giving an alert, perky expression. This breed is known as the “Peter Pan” of cats due to retaining its kittenlike personality throughout life. The Curl has two coat varieties, shorthair and longhair. With her outstanding temperament, the Curl is a people-oriented breed that makes an affectionate soul mate 
		   and easily adjusts to other pets and children.</p>

           <p class="h2">Cat bread: American Shorthair</p>
		   <p>Ancestors of the American Shorthair hunted rats on the ships of early European settlers. These cats flourished alongside the pioneers, eventually becoming the native North American shorthair cat. A true working breed, the American Shorthair is strongly built. This healthy, long-lived cat stands out for her beauty and quiet disposition and makes an ideal companion for 
		   families with children and those having cat friendly dogs.</p>
