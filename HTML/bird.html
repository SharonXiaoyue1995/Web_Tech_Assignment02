                A new study from the Department of Zoology, Oxford University, has found that the individual personalities of male great tits influences how they bond with their future breeding partner.<br /><br/>
				The bolder, more proactive, males choose their future partners sooner, as well as putting more effort into their relationship before the breeding season begins. Shy males are less devoted to forming a strong pair bond, 
				and instead spend more of their time flocking with other females.<br/><br/>
				The findings, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, demonstrate how individual differences in behaviour can shape the formation of crucial social relationships in the wild.
				Dr Josh Firth, who led the research, said: "Finding a mating partner is of upmost importance to these birds, just as it is for many species across the animal kingdom. We wanted to ask why individuals of the same species differ so much in how much effort 
				they put into forming these relationships." My below content is retrieved from https://www.coopsandcages.com.au/blog/ultimate-list-birds-breeds/<br/><br/>

		   <p class="h2">Abyssinian Lovebird</p>
		   <p >The Abyssinian Lovebird belongs to the parrot family and stands out with its mainly green feathers. It is considered as the biggest lovebird of all with a height of 6.25 to 6.5 inches. 
		   It originated in the Eritrea and Ethiopia region. This specific lovebird often lives up to 10 to 20 years. It is also noted for being among the quietest lovebirds. However, they can imitate the human language if they are trained at a young age. 
		   They love to play and climb so they can be taught tricks.</p>

		   <p >The African Grey is believed to have originated in the West and Central African rainforests. It is widely considered as among the smartest birds in the world, earning them the title as 
		   the “thinking man’s” bird. That’s why owners like to give them names such as Freud or Einstein. African Greys also stand out because of their ability to empathise. Given their intelligence, 
		   they prefer playing with puzzle toys and interactive toys.</p>

		   <p class="h2">Amazon Parrots</p>
		   <p >The Amazon parrots originated around the areas of South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. They are noted for their ability to imitate the human speech and various other sounds, 
		   making them good pets and companions. They are mainly green but with accenting colours that can sometimes be vivid. Amazon parrots can be territorial and often show their emotions through their feathers.They are prepared to bite if they fan their feathers, pin their eyes on you, 
		   and poise their legs wide apart. They love food but they love playing even more.</p>
